# LSCAN

The main code for the program is in "LSCAN_analysis.m".

Some of the other .m files were written by other authors: Some .m files are from J. Schneider, based on Sedzinski et al. (2011), and some come from the matlab file exchange. Where this is the case, the original author is usually mentioned in the author credits in the files.
